1. In create_spatial_tuning_function: where does num_neurons, num_colors get defined?

2. In trial_info as a part of parameters, how should I define the various parts of the trial - in update_parameters.

3. Define parameters
fix_time
num_flashes
cycle_time-how long each flash is
num_colors
num_batches

4. How do I define:
eodead
eof
eos
emt
eft
ert

5. How do i decide:
num_spatial_tuned
num_color_tuned

6. Where do self.variables come from? where are they defined?

7. num_batches, trials_per_batch vs. num_trials in new
no more num_batches

8. Structure of generate_taskname_trial
a. End of trial epochs?
b. trial_length?
c. end of neuron indices?
d. duration of mask
e. trial_info
- output, train_mask, sample, test, neural_input
f. Set mask
g. for t in range(self.num_trials)
- generate trial params (x_pos, y_pos, color, zone)
-set mask to reflect beginning of decision time
- 

9. What does n%self.num_colors == c:

10. Should I make a separate tuning function file for delayed match to sample spatial location task?

11. still confused about timing within a trial wrt eodead, eof eos

12. Why does mask_duration have //?

13. defined trial_length in parameters - update dependencies

should I define it in parameters or locally within the function? (like in generate_dualDMS_trial

14. Check if flash_x_pos is correctly defined in generate_spatial_cat_trial. Do I have to do something about dtype?

15. why is n_output default set to 3? should i change it for the spatial stuff?

16. when we set desired output to 1 for all times? - why is the first dimension equal to 0 - shouldnt it be the second dimension?

17. I don't think we need rep_num=0

18. Is there a reason that the get_category_zone has limits on zones that are asymmetric? 5/7 as opposes 4/2? Harder for the network?

19. What is neural_multiplier doing?

20. What is cycle_time_ind?

21. What is dead time exactly for? Why is mask time set to zero during then?

22. check if desired output is correct

TO DO

23. First thing to do is to add white flashes, and it's a non-target. 

Not sure about how to add tuning for the white flash.

TO CHECK - 5 December, 2017

1. Why are trial numbers in each batch different?

2. Rule neurons are 0 during deadtime. 

TO CHECK - 18 December, 2017

1. So, with saved results, I will separately run analysis.py? in anaconda prompt?

2. You should also consider saving weights, model performance, parameters, and trial_time.

3. May be just use the original analyze_model code

TO CHECK - 19 December, 2017

1. Line 277 - model.py - What does stack do? - I THINK I KNOW

2. whatever is stored in state_hist or h or hidden units - for the last iteration that happened - correct?

3. So, if I am training two tasks, I need to make sure to save both? Which task is saved at the moment?

TO ADD - 20 January, 2017

1. In model.py, add a line to save trial_info about both tasks.
